**Tetr-i/o-s**

# üìù Project Description

We are developing a Tetris-inspired game using an event-driven architecture with **four different I/O devices**.  
The core gameplay mimics the original Tetris mechanics ‚Äî including rotating, moving, and dropping pieces onto a grid to complete lines.

The game will feature **additional input flexibility** by supporting mouse buttons for complementary actions, such as rotation or hard drop, enhancing the user experience.  
The **visual output** will be handled through a graphical mode for a smoother and more intuitive interface.

# üéÆ I/O Devices and Their Purpose

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timer

Used to control the **automatic descent** of the current piece at fixed intervals, simulating the game's natural pace and increasing difficulty over time.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard

Main control device used to **move** the active piece left/right, **rotate** it, or **drop** it instantly to the bottom of the grid.

### üñ±Ô∏è Mouse

Used for **secondary actions**:

- **Left click** ‚Üí rotate piece **left**
- **Right click** ‚Üí rotate piece **right**
- **Middle click** ‚Üí perform a **hard drop**

May also be used for interacting with **menus** (optional).

### üñºÔ∏è Graphics

We're gonna use mode 0x105 (1024x758).

Required to **render the game visually** using pixel-based drawing, including:

- The grid
- The falling pieces
- Score display
- UI elements (start screen, pause, game over)
- Se tivermos problemas com a parte gr√°fica podemos tentar usar Key Frames, em vez de gerar a janela inteira gera apenas os pixeis que foram modificados na janela

# üí° Possible Extras

- Visual effects when **lines are cleared**
- ‚ÄúDrop‚Äù animation with **fade effect**
- Clickable **start menu** using the mouse
- **Theme/skin changes** based on level progression
